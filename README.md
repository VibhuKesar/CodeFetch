# atom-code_define

Just a small atom plugin made for a hackathon. It just gives you defination of any "Programming term" selected context.
Short-cut for the plugin is : Ctrl + alt + O. Code output will be in next push.
Though, there are some modules from npm, one has to import before using. 

Happy Coding !
